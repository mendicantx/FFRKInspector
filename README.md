# FFRKInspector

I have no idea what I'm doing yet. This is a disassembled set of code from the last known working solution. With the introduction of the S2GA, the Snow Giant broke the process.

This fixes that small issue to the point where it at least still works.


At the moment, current files will be in the release folder.
